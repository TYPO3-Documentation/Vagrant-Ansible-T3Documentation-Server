   Chef run list: recipe[t3-base]

Initial provisioning
   See `t3-base cookbook <https://github.com/TYPO3-cookbooks/t3-base>`__

   This includes creating users and providing the public SSH key in the :file:`authorized_keys` file.

   .. important::

      On the other hand the Chef cookbook does not touch users that have been created
      otherwise and that Chef doesn't know about.
